    "Data Scientists are now expected to write production code to deploy their machine learning algorithms. Therefore, we need to be aware of software engineering standards and methods to ensure our models are deployed robustly and effectively. One such tool that is very well known in the developer community is `make`. This a powerful Linux command that has been known to developers for a long time and in this article I want to show how it can be used to build efficient machine learning pipelines."
