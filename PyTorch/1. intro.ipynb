    "------------------\n",
    "You can run this tutorial in a couple of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In the cloud**: This is the easiest way to get started! Each section has a \"Run in Microsoft Learn\" link at the top, which opens an integrated notebook in Microsoft Learn with the code in a fully-hosted environment.\n",
    "- **Locally**: This option requires you to setup PyTorch and TorchVision first on your local machine (`installation instructions <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_). Download the notebook or copy the code into your favorite IDE.\n",

    "-----------------\n",
    "If you're familiar with other deep learning frameworks, check out the `0. Quickstart <quickstart_tutorial.html>`_ first\n",
    "to quickly familiarize yourself with PyTorch's API.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're new to deep learning frameworks, head right into the first section of our step-by-step guide: `1. Tensors <tensor_tutorial.html>`_.\n",
