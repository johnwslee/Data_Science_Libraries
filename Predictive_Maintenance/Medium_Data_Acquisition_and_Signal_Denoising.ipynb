    "Predictive maintenance in data science is like having a super-smart way of taking care of machines. Instead of fixing things after they break, we use fancy computer programs and past data to predict when something might go wrong. It’s a bit like having a crystal ball for machines! By doing this, companies can save money and keep their important machines working longer. This method involves keeping a close eye on machines, collecting data in real-time, and using clever computer programs to tell us when it’s time to do maintenance. So, instead of waiting for something to break, we can fix it before it causes a big problem. It’s like giving machines a health check before they get sick!"

    "The Shannon–Hartley Theorem is like a rulebook for how much information can be sent through a communication channel without getting messed up. It tells us that the width of the channel, or how much data it can handle, is super important. So, before choosing devices or tools to monitor things like machines or sensors, we need to make sure the channel is wide enough to handle all the data we want without losing quality.\n",

    "To make things even better, we can be smart about how we use the channel. It’s like finding the best way to arrange our data so that we use the channel space most efficiently. This is called optimizing spectral efficiency. So, when picking sensors, we should choose ones that work really well within the available channel space."
